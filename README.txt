BlackOverflow
=============

This extension will enable the dark theme on StackOverflow without the
need for signing in. Useful for elite anonymous hackers who browse
the interwebs ephemerally by constantly clearing cookies.

Simplest extension in history. Literally just toggles the theme-dark
flag on the body tag in all StackOverflow pages.
