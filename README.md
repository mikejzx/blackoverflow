This extension will enable the dark theme on StackOverflow without the need for signing in.

This is obviously useful for elite anonymous hackers who browse the interwebs ephemerally by constantly clearing their browser's cookies.

Simplest extension in history. Literally just toggles the theme-dark flag on the body tag in all StackOverflow pages.
