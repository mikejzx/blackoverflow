This extension will enable the dark theme on StackOverflow and GitHub without the need for signing in.

This is useful for elite anonymous hackers who constantly clear their browser's cookies and cache ;)

Simplest extension in history. Literally just toggles some flags on any pages under stackoverflow.com and github.com
